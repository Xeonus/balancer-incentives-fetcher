# The Balancer Incentive Fetcher

This project was created with React and Material UI by Xeonus

## What is going on under the hood?

The app is designed to be as lightweight as possible. Core functionality is implemented inside the app without the need of any direct back-ends.

The project itself is deployed via Google Firebase.

## Roadmap (until Fall 2021)

- Calculator mode where you provide your liquidity and get an approximation of your weekly rewards
- Baller mode to support the Balancer liquidity mining committe
- Web3 support including Metamask connection to automatically fetch user parameters and pool metrics
